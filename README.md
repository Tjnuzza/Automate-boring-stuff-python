# Automate-boring-stuff-python

This is a repository of practice stuff in Python. I made it using *Automate the Boring Stuff Using Python (2nd ed.)* by Al Sweigart. I'm a bit out of practice with some of these things and I need to fix that. Also I need to refamiliarize myself with Git because I haven't used it in like two years.

## Chapter 1

I feel like I know enough of the really trivial stuff that I can just mess around with things like string functions and order of operations. Not that hard, yet.
